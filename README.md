# Story Ã  la carte
A prototype of a AR web application for a menu at a new england inspired restaurant. It tells the story about the Mayflower based on food. The goal is to get knowledge across and food recommendations. 

The base code is from Lee Stemkoski's AR-Examples https://github.com/stemkoski/AR-Examples and was edited to function for this Use Case.
